# AI Systems

This repository contains higher-level AI systems that go beyond single models.
The focus is on decision-making, adaptation, and system-level intelligence.

## What This Repo Demonstrates
- Multi-component AI system design
- Feedback loops and self-improvement
- Performance monitoring and drift detection
- Decision logic under uncertainty
- Integration of ML models into intelligent systems

## Included Projects
- self-improving-ml-system  
- adaptive-decision-engine  
- agent-based-learning-system  

## Core Philosophy
- Intelligence emerges from systems, not isolated models
- Feedback and adaptation are mandatory
- Failure modes are explicitly designed for

## How to Navigate
Each project represents a complete AI system composed of multiple interacting components.
